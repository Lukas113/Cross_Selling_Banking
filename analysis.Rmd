This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# activate install if needed
#install.packages("RPostgreSQL")

require("RPostgreSQL")

# define the database connection string
DB_HOST='server2053.cs.technik.fhnw.ch' # or 86.119.36.94 depending on the network
DB_PORT = 5432
DB_DBNAME = 'bank_db' # or 'warenkorb_db'
DB_USERNAME = 'db_user' 
DB_PASSWORD = 'db_user_pw' 

# load the PostgreSQL driver
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
# connect to the database
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname = DB_DBNAME,
                 host = DB_HOST, port = DB_PORT,
                 user = DB_USERNAME, password = DB_PASSWORD)

# TODO
#query <- paste0("SELECT * FROM sales_tbl WHERE date='", dt, "'")
#query <- paste0("SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES")
query <- paste0("SELECT * FROM account")
result <- dbGetQuery(con, query)
print(result)

# close the connection (don't forget to cleanup)
dbDisconnect(con)
dbUnloadDriver(drv)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
